      <p> It began with a simple idea.<br><br> The hope was to create a place for high school students to explore the scope of global issues around them and to offer an opportunity for these students to take part as active young leaders. The reality has gone above and beyond the initial vision for Secondary Schools’ United Nations Symposium, and has only continued to expand and innovate in every possible capacity ever since. <br><br>Organized by a small group of McGill undergraduate students with a desire to bring an exciting new venture to the International Relations Students’ Association of McGill, the inaugural SSUNS was held from November 4th to 7th, 1993 with all conference venues housed throughout the various lecture halls and theaters on McGill’s campus. The inaugural conference was attended by no more than 100 students, mostly hailing from public and private schools in the Greater Montreal Area and Ontario, who participated in just a few committee simulations of the most traditional organs and bodies within the United Nations. <br><br>Since its modest beginnings, SSUNS has grown exponentially in the last 22 years to become the largest Model United Nations conference in Canada. In 2007, SSUNS welcomed its first international delegation from outside North America and is now attended by over 1000 delegates coming from all parts of the globe.

      <p> The ultimate goal of SSUNS is to provide a hands-on learning experience for our delegates in which they are able to apply their education in the classroom into a practical and active setting so as to explore the diverse scope of global issues that affect us each and every day. <br> <br>  SSUNS delegates are not the leaders of tomorrow, but the leaders of today. Youth are not only dreamers and innovators, but also the drivers of change. SSUNS aims to provide an environment that allows each and every delegate to tap into this potential. <br> <br>  Over the past 22 years, SSUNS has been bringing unique and fresh ideas that enhance both the committees and non-committees experience for delegates, faculty advisors, and staff. At the same time, SSUNS maintains the traditions of United Nations and emphasizes cooperation through international diplomacy throughout our committee simulations. <br> <br> Come explore the history and heritage of the beautiful 17th century streets of Old Montréal, stroll down the bustling shops along Saint Catherine, or hike up Mont-Royal for a breathtaking panaromic view of Montréal. Being staffed entirely by McGill students, delegates are also offered opportunities to tour the downtown campus and to hear presentations from McGill professors, discuss with current students, and have questions from the staff. <br> <br> The resolutions of the debates and the lessons learned from the committees does not end with the closing of the conference. We encourage our delegates to take the SSUNS experience and to apply it to their everyday lives through a variety of different events offered both before and during the conference for our delegates to engage in.
