            Dear Prospective Faculty Advisors & Delegates,
            <br><br>
It is my honour to welcome you to the 23rd session of the
Secondary Schools’ United Nations Symposium. On
behalf of the Secretariat, I invite you to the stunning and
historic city of Montreal for four engaging days of
thought-provoking debate, captivating committeesimulation
and unforgettable experiences.
SSUNS caters to all high school students regardless of
experience and brings them together with the hopes of
building engaged, future global leaders. This year’s 23
committees will seek to do just that with a blend of
tradition and innovation found in every General
Assembly, Specialized Agency and Crisis. Our
committees span through almost every major period of
history and cover every continent on the earth in fields
ranging from cyber warfare to mental health. Thus, this
year’s committees ensure that debate will be invigorating
for both first-time and experienced delegates.

At SSUNS, it is truly the faculty advisors and delegates
that breathe life into this conference. Our goal is to build
an open and inclusive environment that fosters the
empowerment of our students. Through collaboration,
debate and negotiation, delegates will tackle the
complexity of global problems in our world today in
hopes of creating a better future. Ultimately, we want the
young diplomats attending SSUNS to understand that
their vision for the world is essential. Their dreams, goals
and ambitions have the capacity to create a lasting effect
on our world today.
I hope I have been able to offer you a glimpse into what
our conference has in store for you this year. On behalf of
our devoted Secretariat and staff, I sincerely hope to see
you this November at SSUNS 2015.
<br> <br>
Best regards, <br>
Dan Ton-That <br>

            Meet Dan, a Montreal native in his second year studying Law at McGill, or otherwise known as SSUNS 2015’s Secretary General. He returns to the Secretariat after having served as Deputy USG GA&ECOSOC last year, and brings a plethora of experience from his illustrious career in debating and Model UN. Dan’s love for MUN stems from its mix of individual empowerment and team engagement, and he has never looked back since his friend secretly signed him up back in CEGEP. Outside of SSUNS and law school, he stays active playing hockey and soccer, spending time with his friends and revisiting Alex Ovechkin’s highlights. Despite having lived in frosty Montreal for so long, Dan is the type of person who will choose going skiing over a nice beach day. In other words, he knows exactly how to make you also fall in love with this beautiful city. Our passionate and dedicated SG promises to bring to you the most memorable and innovative SSUNS yet.

He is born and raised in Montreal and this will be his fifth SSUNS, having participated as a delegate and and then on the Secretariat last year. He was Secretary General of Marimun during his time at Marianopolis, where he also participated as a delegate at WorldMun twice in Vancouver and Melbourne. Koray is a black belt in karate and a world traveller whose favourite destination is Tokyo, Japan. His dream job is to work for Medecins Sans Frontieres, and he has a crush on Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter. Koray is also a lover of cats, just don't tell that to his dog.

            Born in Nepal, Patrick's studies took him through Royal West Academy and Marianopolis College in Montreal before he reached McGill University to study engineering. Aside from coding and overseeing everything tech at SSUNS, Patrick spends his time on the basketball court or picking out the perfect tie bar for his always impeccable outfits. He hopes one day to work at a technology start-up in San Francisco, and follow in the footsteps of an idol of his, Elon Musk (and we at SSUNS have no doubt that he will!). Delegates, rest assured that the conference’s IT is in great hands - it’s our pleasure to work with Pat this year.

            Our very own USG Finance, Sheldon Benard, hails from the capital of Alberta. As you would expect, his favourite subject is math, and he plans to major in both Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Finance. He participated in MUN as a delegate for three years in high school, and worked as a Delegate Resource Centre coordinator at SSUNS 2014. At McGill, he acts as the Vice President of Finance for the FreeThoughts organization, and will be working at a bank this summer. In his spare time, he enjoys solving logic puzzles, playing Led Zeppelin on the electric guitar, and rocking the power and libero positions on the volleyball court. His ideal vacation would be backpacking through Indochina and Europe, and his favourite meal is prime rib. Sheldon is incredibly excited for SSUNS 2015!

            With years of Model United Nations experience under her belt in both delegation and staff roles, Meghan Keenan was the perfect choice for this year’s Deputy USG Committees: GAs. Although currently undecided where her degree in Psychology and IDS will take her, this motivated U1 student has repeatedly demonstrated her aptitude in several fields. Beyond academics, Meghan has participated in a wide variety of sports including soccer, hockey, volleyball, ultimate Frisbee, and more. Clearly not one to be messed with, this Deputy has earned herself a black belt in karate and has roughed it on a canoe for over 50 days. Of course, Meghan also enjoys the simpler things in life such as food, hugs, and SSUNS.

            May or Hyunji, a native of Seoul, South Korea moved to Vancouver in 2007, at the age of 12. She attended R.E. Mountain Secondary in Langley, British Columbia before arriving in Montreal and studying International Development with a focus on economics and political science at McGill. May has a passion for Model United Nations, having participated as a delegate at up to 8 conferences, co-founded the MUN club at her alma mater and served on the secretariat for its inaugural MUN conference. When taking a break from school work or conference prep, May enjoys discovering new and unique parts of Montreal or watching her favourite movie “About Time”, a movie she firmly believes to be, an absolute classic. An interesting fact about May is her reason for selecting her english name. At the age of 12, she knew she wanted to be someone friendly and approachable and so she decided to choose a name that rhymed with the word “hey”. Knowing her, she certainly exemplifies such a quality as she is always there to lend an ear or a hand. In the end, May is beyond excited to manage the Specialized Agencies in the hopes of ensuring that delegates have an unforgettable experience at SSUNS 2015!

He has helped lead committees pertaining to Iran and the Chinese Civil War, both of which allowed him to explore new things of interest to him.

This passion for Model UN pushed her to attend a variety of conferences within Canada and Internationally. As a second year majoring in International Development studies, Christina’s dream is to intern and subsequently work for the United Nations. A natural hardworker, she has been extensively involved in helping her community in and outside of school, notably within student government and environmental clubs.

           The definitions of the words dedication and passion could have originated from one of our Deputy PRs, Casey Wang. His perseverance and drive for success have led him to the prestigious Med-P program at McGill University, where not only does he thrive in the constant pressure and competition, he actually embraces it and uses it to increase his zeal. The strange affinity for bananas aside, Casey enjoys fruits of all shapes and sizes. Having been first introduced to Model UN at a young age in high school, Casey continued his MUN career at Marianopolis College in Montreal before continuing what has now become a distinguished career in Model UN at McGill. Casey manages to fulfill the term “well-rounded” to tremendous heights, by participating in everything from sustainable development organizations overseas to first-aid training organizations worldwide. Casey specializes in improving lives of people around him, and representing the youth community to the best of his abilities. In his personal life, Casey requires a daily dose of Taylor Swift and a healthy protein smoothie to keep the motivation and the gains that he procures pumping large quantities of iron at the gym. A self-professed social media savant, we at SSUNS are sure that he will be an extremely important contributor to the best SSUNS conference yet.

As a young child with ambitions of travelling across the nation to study business at McGill University, Adam is now proudly living the dream and enjoying every moment of it. A onetime MUN delegate and a past committee staffer at multiple conferences, Adam hopes to marry his passion for Model UN with his astute business acumen in order to bring the best to his Public Relations portfolio. Adam’s knack for all things trade and commerce can only be matched by his athletic prowess, having practiced sports as diverse as hockey and mixed martial arts to soccer and snowboarding from a tender age. With trips to such destinations as Mexico, Germany and the Czech Republic under his belt, our seasoned voyager’s intrepid desire for adventure has most recently taken him on exchange to Amsterdam, where he will further develop his knowledge of European culture before returning to Montreal in time for SSUNS 2015.  With his carefree and outgoing personality, Adam is ready to contribute his skills to what will surely be the best SSUNS conference yet.
